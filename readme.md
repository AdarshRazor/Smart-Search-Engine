# Smart Search Engine

SSE is basic model of Seach Engine or what people say "Google Search". The working of the model is based on wikipedia content and the second part of the program use the words from content and use to learn and train the search for better understanding.

## Installation

For this project I used [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-391/)

Use the command to install the reqired modules:

* Python2: pip install -r requirements.txt

* Python3: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Open command line in the folder ( CTRL + L )

Play with any topic and see if the module is good enough to recognise and provide the correct information.
Stay update for the more features.
